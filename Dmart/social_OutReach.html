  <strong id="found">Better Schools, Brighter Futures!</strong><br><br>

  <p id="found">At DMart, we believe in corporate social responsibility and have always been committed to contributing
    to the communities in which we operate. While being focused on sustained economic performance, we are also acutely
    aware of the necessity and importance of social stewardship. Towards this end, we seek to enrich the lives of the
    future generation – the children of our country – through our efforts to create better environments and
    infrastructure in public schools in select wards of Mumbai city.</p>
  <p id="found">We have a school excellence program through which we aim to develop infrastructure , improve educational
    facilities and work towards sustainable progress in public schools in selected wards of Mumbai . We work with these
    schools and seek to implement better teaching facilities (such as libraries & science labs) and develop
    infrastructure (such as toilets and playgrounds) by working with partner organisations. We hope to improve the
    quality of education and provide children with better education and development opportunities.</p>
  <p id="found">Our constant focus on educating the citizens of tomorrow has seen strong progress in the current year.
    In FY 2018-19, we have aided more than 95,000 students and helped them in their goal of educating themselves for a
    better tomorrow. Our intent is to continue working towards foundational learning among the students leading to basic
    grade specific student learning outcomes.</p>

          English language is one of the key enablers that connects our increasingly diverse world. Through our
          programme, we aim at improving spoken English skills of children in their elementary years using phonics and
          other relevant techniques. This intervention happens on a day-to-day basis through trained teachers and
          detailed lesson plans. The children have applied these skills by participating in extempore, mono acting etc.
          In addition, government teachers have also started using these techniques in their respective classes.
